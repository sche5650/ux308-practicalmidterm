Late in 2019 Bon Iver released his 4th studio album, i,i, to much critical acclaim. The album, an indie music masterpiece, was the last album in a set of four and completed a cyclical journey through the four seasons of human experience. This musical masterpiece is a testimate to Justin Vernon and co.'s intense, and ultimately beautiful, creative process.
